<p align="justify">
The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a substantial loss of human life throughout the world, and it poses an unprecedented threat to workplace, public health. Schools, universities, and government offices, public venues shopping malls etc., it is necessary to have a check on body temperature and whether a person is wearing mask or not to avoid Covid-19 spread.<br>We are intended to design a Mask detector model which gives high accuracy when compared to other models and the designed Mask detector model can be efficiently run in the Raspberry Pi. To achieve this, we have trained using various algorithms and comparison is done based on accuracy and precision values and how efficiently the system works. A continuous temperature monitoring is done using the temperature sensor if the person is wearing the mask and having the average body temperature the entry system will be opened.<br>In this project we designed a deep learning model for face mask detection using MobileNetV2 which gave us a accuracy of 99.29% which is better than other algorithms and performs efficiently in Raspberry Pi.</p>
